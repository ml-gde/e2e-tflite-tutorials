# E2E TFLite Tutorials

Here is a list of sample app ideas and projects.

We would love your help! You can help by creating a tflite model ready for implementation, add a mobile app idea that needs a tflite model created, or write an end-to-end tutorial with sample code. 

This is also where you can seek help from the community.

## Project ideas (help needed!)
If you are interested in helping out, take a look at the potential projects below and assign an corresponding issue to yourself from the [repo issue](https://github.com/ml-gde/e2e-tflite-tutorials/issues) list.

Once you form a project team, move the idea to the "in progress" section below, create a new repo and link to it. 

* YOLO - [overview](overviews/yolo.md).
* Classify pose - [overview](overviews/classify_pose.md) (an example use-case can be found [here](https://github.com/ml-gde/e2e-tflite-tutorials/issues/33)).
* A mobile application (preferably Android/iOS) demonstrating text detection with CRAFT and EAST (refer to [this blog post](https://sayak.dev/optimizing-text-detectors/)).
* A mobile application (preferably Android/iOS) demonstrating optical character recognition (refer to [this Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tulasiram58827/ocr_tflite/blob/main/colabs/ENDTOEND_OCR_TFLITE.ipynb) to see how this is done in Python).

Here are some more details on how exactly you can help:

* Generate ideas
* Create tflite model(s)
* Create Colab Notebook(s) demonstrating the model creation process along with running inference in Python
* Publish tflite model(s) optional
* Develop Android app(s) to demonstrate the model(s)
* Develop iOS app(s) to demonstrate the model(s)

The tutorials listed below would give you a good idea of the afore-mentioned pointers. The [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/ml-gde/e2e-tflite-tutorials/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) provide detailed instructions on **how you can contribute**.

## End-to-end tutorials (in progress)
Take a look at the in progress projects to see what it's like to work on a project.

* [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) - a very popular ASR framewor - [project repo](https://github.com/AbdulRashidReshamwala/DeepSpeech_demo).
* Enhanced super res GAN - [project repo](https://github.com/margaretmz/esrgan-e2e-tflite-tutorial).
* Speech Command - [overview](overviews/speech_command.md).
* Boundless model for image extrapolation - [project notebook](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Adventures-in-TensorFlow-Lite/blob/master/Boundless_TFLite.ipynb).
